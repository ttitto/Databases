Problem 1.	What is SQL? What is DML? What is DDL? Recite the most important SQL commands.
Perform a research (e.g. in Google or Wikipedia) and provide an information about SQL, data manipulation language, data definition language and the most important SQL commands.

SQL - Structured Query Language -  is a special-purpose programming language designed for managing data held in a relational database management system (RDBMS), or for stream processing in a relational data stream management system (RDSMS).

DML - Data Manipulation Language -  is the subset of SQL used to add, update and delete data. Commands: INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

DDL - Data Definition Language -  manages table and index structure. The most basic items of DDL are the CREATE, ALTER, RENAME, DROP and TRUNCATE statements.
